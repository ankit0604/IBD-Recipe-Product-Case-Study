### Product Case Study

## Problem Statement

The non-profit organization wants to introduce a **Recipe** section on its website to support the IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) community.
Currently, patients rely on external websites, blogs, and printed materials for dietary guidance. There is no centralized digital solution within the organization’s platform.
The goal is to provide structured, verified, and personalized recipe guidance directly through the website.
