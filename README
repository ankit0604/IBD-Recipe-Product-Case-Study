# IBD Recipe Feature – Product Case Study

---

## 1. Problem Statement

The members of the non-profit organization want to introduce a new section called "Recipe" on their website.

This feature aims to help the IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) community cook recipes based on dietary preferences while also allowing contributors (Doctors, Nutritionists, Experts) to submit relevant recipes.

Currently, patients are redirected to external websites, blogs, or printed materials for dietary guidance.
